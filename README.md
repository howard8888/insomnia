Treating Insomnia-- Psychotherapy (CBT-I) and Psychopharmacology

(PowerPoint slides from the presentation can be downloaded from this GitHub page.)

Note: May 2025 -- I have ended up using GitHub for a convenient source to store various papers so they can easily be accessed by others, as noted by the various papers in this repository, i.e., not just the 2017 insomnia presentation but the current collection of papers/presentations/code snippets. (Most of my code is not here but on a local Git system -- please contact me directly for access to any particular code.)
